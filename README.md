<h2>📓Context</h2>
<li>Started experimenting with SDR in Summer 2023. I quickly got familiar with Radio Frequencies (RF) and their modulation techniques AM, FM.</li>
<li>Then, during Winter 2024, I got a Flipper Zero, which I used to get familiar with Sub-GHz frequencies.</li>
<li>Seeing the interest I had in frequencies and telecommunications led me to the development of this project!</li>
