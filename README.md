<h2>📓Context</h2>
<li>I started experimenting with Software defined Radios (SDR) in the summer of 2023. Using the <a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr-smart-sdr.html">Nooelec SDR</a> I quickly became familiar with receiving all kinds of Radio Frequencies (RF) like AM radio, FM radio, public security radio and many more.</li>
<li>Then, in the winter 2024, I got a Flipper Zero, which I used to further my comprehension of Sub-GHz frequencies.</li>
<li>Finally, seeing the interest I had in frequencies and telecommunications led me to the development of this project!</li>
